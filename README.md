This mini repo is for reproducing the 7 basic types of unmerged paths (merge conflicts) :

```
DD    unmerged, both deleted
AU    unmerged, added by us
UD    unmerged, deleted by them
UA    unmerged, added by them
DU    unmerged, deleted by us
AA    unmerged, both added
UU    unmerged, both modified
```

To reproduce these, switch to `our_branch` and perform a merge from `their_branch`!
